(we know, all focus was on games for this version, sorry)

* Flashpoint Infinity has been introduced thanks to the efforts of davidar.

* We've decided to include Fiddler by default, instead of having it as an option.

* The redirector's been updated again, hopefully for more reliability.

* Arcade now has an updated Pale Moon with support for Unity Web Player games.

* The batch files have been updated so that you can right-click > run as administrator; hopefully this will help some of the people who've had redirector issues.

* A ton of games have been moved to work on the server for consistency across the whole project, and to help everything work in Flashpoint Infinite. This has caused some files to move and some savegames to no longer work. Sorry, but we had to do it eventually. Only two Flash games load locally now: Captain America Shield of Justice and Western Front 1914.

* A lot of game files and launch commands have been modified to work with Infinity; this might result in some games not working, so we need testers to go through and check.

* Add: Added a level database for Super Mario Flash 1 & 2.
* Add: Better logo for Skyworks Lanes.
* Fix: CLOP's prompt has been edited.
* Fix: Deleted some needlessly downloaded files that had extremely long names.
* Fix: Fixed Cyberchase: Save the Park.
* Fix: Fixed Ino's Desire is now Hidden, as it's a porn game.
* Fix: Fixed Puzzlestuck's name.
* Fix: Fixed The Great Gatsby's crashing cutscenes (we were missing some files).
* Fix: Fixed logo for Lenny Loosejocks in Space.
* Fix: Fixed screenshots for the Cartoon Cartoon sequels.
* Fix: Made an attempt to fix Armor Mayhem Chronicles (it's a problem I'm not having for some reason).
* Fix: Moved the Pirateers SWF into the ArmorGames.com directory; you can now play the Armor Games exclusive ship.
* Fix: Ragdoll Achievement's browser prompt is gone now. Whoops.
* Fix: Replaced Little Rocketman with a version provided from the developer.
* Fix: Sift Heads: World Act 2's message prompt is gone because the problem seems to have fixed itself...
* Fix: Tons of minor changes I've forgotten about.
* Fix: Tried to fix My Little Pony Adventures in Ponyville again.
* Fix: Unhacked Beat Master 3000 (it now uses an older Flash projector instead).
* Fix: Unhacked Elements (Neutral).
* Fix: Updated Feudalism II to the ArcadeTown version (now has character customization).
* Fix: Updated Rebuild.
* Fix: Updated Corebound.
* Fix: Updated Solipskier to a DRM-free version from the developer's website.
* Fix: Flipside now actually plays Flipside instead of Canopy.
* Fix: Give Up, Robot now actually has the game in the collection. (How did I even miss that one?)

* Fixed some swapped WGJ4K logos and screenshots in Theatre.

* Updated LaunchBox to 8.2. Don't think it has much to do with Flashpoint. I don't like the new interface.

* Flashpoint no longer needs to install; now that the reason for the weird installer is gone, it doesn't need to do that. It just runs from the zip.

* Updated the readme to remove a few things and add a link to the new Discord. https://discord.gg/S9uJ794

Flashpoint 3.1 - Opening Night

Flashpoint now consists of two seperate projects - Flashpoint Arcade and Flashpoint Theatre. Changes will be split into two sections - if a change is unique to that version it'll be there.

We fiddled with some of the not-Flashpoint-related XML files included in LaunchBox, and cut the launch time by a factor of 10. Seriously, it opens in like a second now.

Note: we have NOT updated to LaunchBox 8.3 yet, since the majority of features are mainly for LaunchBox Next, and we aren't ready to upgrade yet.

We now have rudimentary controller support! You can right-click a game, and if it has "Start With Controller Support" as an option, it will open the utility AntiMicro with a profile already set to go alongside the game, and will close along with Flash Player. When Launchbox closes, AntiMicro will attempt to be closed again, in an instance where it might not have been closed properly the first time. This probably will interrupt any other controller supporting apps as long as it's open. Here's a list of games that support controllers right now:
 * :the game:
 * Abobo's Big Adventure
 * Alien Hominid
 * Boxhead
 * Canabalt
 * Robot Unicorn Attack
 * Upgrade Complete

Added the beta for The Impossible Game. Right click on The Impossible Game's Launchbox entry.

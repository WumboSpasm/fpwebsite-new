The Flash Player projector executable has been updated to version 29 (previously 28 in all of the Flashpoint test runs).

The entire set is now TorrentZipped; new versions now won't need a complete redownload of the entire set. The entire set has been reorganized to accomodate for TorrentZipping.

Almost every game in the set has been played with due to this, which is why I'm fully expecting to put out a Release 1.1 to fix a few issues.

We're back to the batch file, because half of the antiviruses in the world (not including the one I'm using) detected the executable as either a generic Trojan or a bitcoin miner.

The batch file has had some QoL updates; it'll now error out if it can't find the games folder, it will install the prerequisites only once, during setup, and it now also installs .NET Framework 4.7, to cover all of the prerequisite bases.

The readme also got a bit of a tuneup.

Adds the new 'keys to the kingdom' system. We now have a much more effective method for subverting sitelocks, thanks to the community. A lot of hacked games have been updated with untouched SWFs in order to take advantage of this new system while being 1:1 copies of the original games.

This also fixes over half of the games that previously required use of a browser; Gravitee Wars, Ragdoll Achievement, Fantastic Contraption and Chuck the Sheep now all run properly without one.

This is also the first version of Flashpoint to use DarkMoe's Autocurator. The metadata may be a little weird because of that, but hopefully adding newer games should be much faster than before on my end.

We now have an Extras folder for game files that should be included for archival sake.

Replaced the Rose & Camellia games with more archival-complete versions. They'll need to be retested for safety.

Fault Line now uses an older Flash projector executable - this lets it run without lagging when the mouse moves.

Updated Infectonator: World Dominator with a hacked version that unlocks its final level.

Fixed a few embarassing metadata errors. There's always more though!

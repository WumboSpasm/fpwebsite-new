* Games I couldn't add
 * Bloons TD 5. For whatever reason, the standalone, even directly from their website, doesn't load a stage.

* The batch file has had a few major updates:
 * There's an EXE now that not only does the same thing, but launches -no- windows except for LaunchBox, meaning it's a heck of a lot more user friendly. The batch file is still there, though. If this works out, it'll probably only be a debug launcher.
 * Apache doesn't appear at all anymore either so it can't be closed accidentally. I will need to find a way to troubleshoot Apache if something goes wrong, though.
 * The installers for the Visual C++ redistributable now wait their turns instead of trying to execute simultaneously.

* Removed my Apache log files from the zip, because I'm an idiot.

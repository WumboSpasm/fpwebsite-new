Flashpoint 1.4

1.4 is the result of over 100 requests given to us since the big public push thanks to the Medium article I wrote up, so the credits list for this one would be a mile long if I credited everyone. You guys know who you are, though!

And of course, special credits to DarkMoe and SpikePit.

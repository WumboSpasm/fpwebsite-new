Hey folks. This month has been a bit of a slow one, but there's still been plenty of curations that have been made, and progress towards the future of Flashpoint is always going on, so I've whipped up a mini status update to let you know what we're working on. Not big enough for an everyone beep in my opinion, but just enough to let you know we aren't dead over here. Enjoy.

We're hoping to have 8.1 out by July, probably.

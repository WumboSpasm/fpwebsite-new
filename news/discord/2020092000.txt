Hey folks. We've been raided twice today by bots that send DMs to people, telling them they've won some kind of cryptocurrency. As true now as always, if it sounds too good to be true, it probably is; ignore, delete, block and report these bots as you see them. We'll be trying to keep up with the waves of them if they continue. Sorry for the inconvenience.

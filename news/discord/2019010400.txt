Hey everyone, we're in the process of transitioning our request system to Google Sheets/Google Forms so we're locking down the channels for Java, Unity, HTML5 and #requested-other-games. We kindly ask that you submit any new requests for these platforms through our Google Form which is located here: https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdd9ifSu_anYKMKE280c3Y3dkmuEApr5N6gKnAmTvKh0F5txA/viewform

You can also view the Google Sheet in it's entirety here: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1t0MbYMGm4dq4d5hA1l6MKuVYGyw9XU8UOPHjy2ceHX8/edit?usp=sharing

The other request channels will remain unlocked so you can continue submitting them through Discord for now until we finish converting them. As such, please do not submit any Flash/Shockwave/Animations through the form until we have finished converting those channels. Ask staff if you have any questions.

@everyone

This is not a content release, but there are a lot of things that I'd like to talk about now. I apologize if you were expecting an update. With that said, hope you've had a Merry Christmas, or other holidays you celebrate around this time.

There's a new Flashpoint Twitter account that we made recently that we'll be posting fun factoids, bios and random games on from time to time, also including things like new releases. If you feel like following that, head over to https://twitter.com/fp_archive. It just posted a tweet celebrating the third anniversary project of Flashpoint, which just so happened to be yesterday!

There was a video released by Nick Robinson recently about Mission in Snowdriftland, and ow it may be "lost", and for one of a few potential reasons, there was some misinformation shared about Flashpoint. These issues include some kind of odd software he uses that makes Flashpoint look like we don't actually save the games we archive, which is not true. I've gone over the issues in my own video on the subject to correct them and dig into how he may have fumbled this particular ball, which you can view here: https://youtu.be/POHBOjgOqRE Please share this video around to places the original video was shared, as I'm worried that misinformation about Flashpoint and its capabilities could spread far enough to be harmful to our efforts as a team. **Please don't harass Nick over this video. There's no point. No one benefits. Don't be one of those people.**

As for the upcoming death of Flash in a little under 3 weeks, while there hasn't been any major updates as to what might happen when the clock strikes midnight on the 12th, we're watching everything very closely and will update you if anything changes.

Enjoy the rest of your holidays, and stay safe.

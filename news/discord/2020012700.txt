Hello @everyone. Flashpoint 7.1, "Stay on Target" is now available at the usual places (#downloads, the website).

First thing is an apology. I originally pushed Flashpoint 7.0 out the door in a state that, looking back at all the problems we've found regarding it over the past month, was not acceptable. I don't really have an excuse; we should have held out for longer. 7.1 is the first in a set of steps to fix up things; 7.1 has been put out relatively quickly to push out multiple fixes and updates that should have gone out with 7.0. This includes fixes for the launcher, a fair few games that found themselves broken in 7.0, and 2000+ games and 100+ new animations on top of that.

There's more coming in 7.2 and onwards, of course, but that'll be for another time. Please enjoy the new release and flood us with bug reports if you find them.

We're always looking for more translators (https://fpl-translations.bluemaxima.org/), curators, and others to help work on the project. If you've got the spare time, please consider helping us out.

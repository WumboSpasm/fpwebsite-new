The problem for Windows 7 users has been resolved with a small patch. This also resolves issues with 3DVIA Player and PopCap Plugin that we didn't identify during testing.

Here's a link to the patch: https://bluemaxima.org/flashpoint/Flashpoint_Proxy_Patch.zip

Here's instructions:

**Haven't downloaded Infinity yet**: Download Infinity normally. The patch has been applied to the version we're distributing now.
**Have already downloaded Infinity**: Download the patch, extract the zip, move the folder so that the folders match up, overwrite all existing files, or redownload Infinity.
**Have downloaded Ultimate**: See above instructions, minus the re-download bit - we can't update Ultimate in the same way.

Sorry for the trouble.
